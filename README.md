# Fall-Guard

Fall-Guard is a real-time fall detection system leveraging YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) for human pose estimation and OpenCV for video processing. Designed to enhance elderly care and safety, this project detects sudden falls in live camera feeds or video files, triggering alerts to prevent prolonged unattended incidents.

## üåü Feature
* Real-time fall detection using posture analysis and bounding box tracking.
* Supports live camera input (webcam/IP cam) or pre-recorded videos.
* Built with Python, OpenCV, and Ultralytics YOLOv8 for high accuracy.
* Customizable alerts (visual/sound/notifications) for responders.
* Optional data logging for incident analysis.

## ‚öô Use Cases:

* Elderly care facilities
* Home monitoring systems
* Healthcare safety applications
